### Data Science Projects 

[Analysis and Prediction of Voter Turnout Percentage in USA](https://github.com/rakesh-emuru/Data-Science/tree/main/Projects/Analysis%20and%20Prediction%20of%20Voter%20Turnout%20Percentage%20in%20USA)

The purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the behavior and characteristics of voter turnout in the United States. The research examines voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election for every county in the USA and investigates the impact of sociodemographic variables on voter turnout. The project aims to create a voter turnout model using machine learning to predict optimal conditions for higher electoral turnout rates. The findings will inform policymakers in designing and implementing electoral policies to increase voter participation.
