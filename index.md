[Analysis and Prediction of Voter Turnout Percentage in USA](https://github.com/rakesh-emuru/Data-Science/tree/main/Projects/Analysis%20and%20Prediction%20of%20Voter%20Turnout%20Percentage%20in%20USA)
<br/>

The purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the behaviour and some characteristics of voter turnout in the United States. To this end, the research team will examine voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election, for every county in the USA. The study will inquire on the effect of sociodemographic variables on the voter turnout. The aim is to provide a voter turnout model able to predict the optimal conditions to achieve the highest electoral turnout rates. This project will yield evidence that can be used by policymakers to inform electoral policy design and implementation.It will assist policymakers to follow evidence informed policy choices and making more Americans take part in the elections.
